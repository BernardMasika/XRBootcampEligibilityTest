Installation Instructions :

  1. Import the FinalIK package into your project
  2. Extract the FinalIK Integration package that this package (VR Interaction Framework) provides, found at : "BNG Framework/Integrations/FinalIK.unityPackage"
  
- After installation, you can run the demo scene that was just extracted into this directory (VRIK.unity). This scene contains a mirror and a few simple items so you can test out how IK works.

- There are two version of the IK setup : 1 for 1-Handed objects, that uses one FinalIK rig, and another example that allows for two-handed objects, which uses two rigs. Make sure to inspect both so you can get a good understanding of how they work.

- For hand animations to work, make sure you have a reference hand model setup and assigned. It can be helpful to turn on the reference model's mesh renderer to debug issues.

- I've setup the FinalIK soldier and crash test dummy with VRIK so you can have a couple of different example to work off of
