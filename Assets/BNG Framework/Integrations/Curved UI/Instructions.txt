VRIF Supports the Curved UI asset. The included .unityPackage makes integration quick and easy :

1. Install the Curved UI asset from the asset store : https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/curved-ui-vr-ready-solution-to-bend-warp-your-canvas-53258

2. Extract the included .unityPackage found at /BNG Framework/Integrations/Curved UI/CurvedUI.unityPackage

3. Place the "CurvedUIPointer.prefab" object somewhere on your characters controllers / hands. For example, you can parent it to the "RightHandPointer" transform on the XR Rig.

That's it! You may want to tweak the input - by default input is set to Right Trigger. 

** Important! - This setup uses Curved UI's custom input system. MAKE SURE VRUISystem is not in the scene, and that no VRIF "UIPointer" objects are in the scene either (they will create the VRUISystem when they try to access it). Otherwise VRUISystem may conflict with CurvedUI's. To make sure none are included, type "VRUISystem" and "UIPointer" into the Hierarchy search, and make sure no components show up.
