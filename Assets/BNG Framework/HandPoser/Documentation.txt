Please make sure the Oculus Integration Package is installed if you plan on using the Quest Hand Tracking scene. The Oculus Integration package can be found here : https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022

After installing the Oculus Integration Package you can then extract the "Quest Hand Tracking.unityPackage" file which contains the sample scene. If you don't have the integration package installed you will see the prefab names in red due to missing references.
